        <p>Elon Musk , a name which very few who don't know about.
        In Today's World he is the richest person and one of the best leading buisness companies CEO. Elon Musk was Born in Pretoria,South Africa.Since Childhood he had curiosity towards the computers.In his teenage he created a game which he was able to sell to a company .Since Childhood he was considered as unusual kid , beacuse whenever he concentrated he was able to get totally engrossed in that thing and as if the entire world was nothing for him.Later for his further studies he moved in to Canada at age 17. </p>
        Musk attended Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, and in 1992 he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, where he received bachelor’s degrees in physics and economics in 1997. He enrolled in graduate school in physics at Stanford University in California, but he left after only two days because he felt that the Internet had much more potential to change society than work in physics. In 1995 he founded Zip2, a company that provided maps and business directories to online newspapers. In 1999 Zip2 was bought by the computer manufacturer Compaq for $307 million, and Musk then founded an online financial services company, X.com, which later became PayPal, which specialized in transferring money online. The online auction eBay bought PayPal in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

          <p style="color:black ;">
            SolarCity heavily focused on door-to-door sales of leased systems, where customers would pay no upfront costs, but agreed to purchase the power generated by those panels from the company for 20 years. The business model became the most popular in the US and made the company the largest residential solar installer, but it caused SolarCity to have over $1.5 billion in debt by the time of its acquisition in 2016

            According to me the biggest Achievement among many great things Done by Elon musk was when the Facon Rocket took a shot in the sky. All the Rocket Booster landed exactly the same place where they started.Makng resualble rockets is one of the great things and one step towards the sustainable use resources.The Falcon 9 has performed 164 lauches and has 124 successfull landing .
